# Gunner's Rewind  
**GameWorld in the Web3**

## Requirements to Play:
- Be connected to the **Shape Mainnet Blockchain**
- Use **MetaMask** wallet

## Controls:
- **WASD** to move
- Player points toward **Mouse Position**
- **Right Click** to shoot
- **Hold E** to place a checkpoint

## Important Information:
- Currently, there are only **2 functional rooms**. More are coming soon!

## Current Bugs:
- Enemies can pass through walls.
- The player can't shoot when touching the right walls.
- Pressing **E** multiple times without holding it will still place a checkpoint.
- If the player dies without placing checkpoints, values do not reset.
